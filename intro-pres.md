# (Re)Configuring Data Services for the Campus Community
## 

--

### Focus

* Subject specialists/liaisons ("train the trainer")
* Data and tech for research support
* Needs assessment and trust building ("right-sizing")
* Outreach, adverstising, branding, etc.

--

### Key Services

* Data reference/acquisition
* Data curation/archiving
* Computational research support ("point of contact")
* Workshops/technical reference
* Operational support - **your data is important, too!**

--

### Things to Avoid

* Communication breakdown
* Stagnation of relevant services
* Information/service outsourcing
* "I didn't know a librarian could help with that..."

--

### Give Me Feedback

* Insight into the work/needs of faculty and students
* Assistance in assessing gaps in service
* Identification of new opportunities
* Ideas?
